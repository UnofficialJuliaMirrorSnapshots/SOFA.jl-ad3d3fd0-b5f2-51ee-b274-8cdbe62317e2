Transformation from ICRS to Galactic Coordinates.

This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.

Status:  support function.

Given:
    dr     double      ICRS right ascension (radians)
    dd     double      ICRS declination (radians)

Returned:
    dl     double      galactic longitude (radians)
    db     double      galactic latitude (radians)

Notes:

  1. The IAU 1958 system of Galactic coordinates was defined with
    respect to the now obsolete reference system FK4 B1950.0.  When
    interpreting the system in a modern context, several factors have
    to be taken into account:

    . The inclusion in FK4 positions of the E-terms of aberration.

    . The distortion of the FK4 proper motion system by differential
      Galactic rotation.

    . The use of the B1950.0 equinox rather than the now-standard
      J2000.0.

    . The frame bias between ICRS and the J2000.0 mean place system.

    The Hipparcos Catalogue (Perryman & ESA 1997) provides a rotation
    matrix that transforms directly between ICRS and Galactic
    coordinates with the above factors taken into account.  The
    matrix is derived from three angles, namely the ICRS coordinates
    of the Galactic pole and the longitude of the ascending node of
    the galactic equator on the ICRS equator.  They are given in
    degrees to five decimal places and for canonical purposes are
    regarded as exact.  In the Hipparcos Catalogue the matrix
    elements are given to 10 decimal places (about 20 microarcsec).
    In the present SOFA function the matrix elements have been
    recomputed from the canonical three angles and are given to 30
    decimal places.

  2. The inverse transformation is performed by the function iauG2icrs.

Called:
    iauAnp       normalize angle into range 0 to 2pi
    iauAnpm      normalize angle into range +/- pi
    iauS2c       spherical coordinates to unit vector
    iauRxp       product of r-matrix and p-vector
    iauC2s       p-vector to spherical
